Plot-Bot is a robot that draws SVG files onto a whiteboard. It can draw on anything you can mount flat on a wall: plywood or poster paper work too. It is controlled in the browser and uses Node.js with [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) to control 2 stepper motors via an Arduino.
