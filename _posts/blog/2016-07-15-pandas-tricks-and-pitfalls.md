Data munging is the least sexiest part of <abbr title="Data Science">"the sexiest job of the 21st century"</abbr>. According to authoritative popular sources like [@BigDataBorat](https://twitter.com/BigDataBorat), data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning up data. So we need to be really good at it!

[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is an awesome python library for manipulating any data that fits in a spreadsheet-like format.  If you're familiar with R, it's the R dataframes concept implemented in Python. Since the goal of data munging in data science is often to generate a matrix to be fed into a machine learning model, `pandas` is a valuable tool to data scientists who use python.

At the beginning of my time at Metis's Data Science Bootcamp, I decided to learn everything I could about pandas by diving deep into the docs. The docs are good, but there is a very steep learning curve and the syntax can be tricky sometimes. At Metis, I got the nickname "The Panda King" because I helped my fellow students solve their pandas problems. There was even a Slack emoji made (thanks Hannah):

# Tutorial: Pandas Tricks & Pitfalls

I did a workshop for my class at Metis called "Pandas Tricks & Pitfalls", and the Jupyter Notebooks are available on GitHub for anyone who wants to go through and learn more about pandas. There are two notebooks: the main notebook, `pandas_tricks.ipynb`, which has examples and explanations, and the worksheet notebook `pandas_exercises.ipynb` with exercises you can try as you follow along. Please contact me if you find anything confusing or vague. I'm also always open to answer your pandas questions!

## Covered in Pandas Tricks and Pitfalls:
* Understanding `groupby` in pandas
* Working with dates and times
* Binning with `resample` and `cut`
* MultiIndexing
* Some plotting tricks with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
