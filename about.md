I am Jeff Coggshall, a data scientist who thinks in systems. Vox Menthe is where I keep public notes on the technical problems I am exploringâ€”analytics, infrastructure, and the experiments that bridge them.

This new version of the site is intentionally minimal. Every post aims to ship fast, stay accurate, and leave enough context for future me (and you) to iterate safely.
